# Enhanced Error Handling Report

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive error handling improvements made to the MCP Shell Server to prevent commands from getting stuck and provide better error recovery.

## Changes Made

### 1. Reduced Timeouts for Better Responsiveness
- **DEFAULT_TIMEOUT**: Reduced from 3600s (1 hour) to 300s (5 minutes)
- **STREAMING_TIMEOUT**: Reduced from 300s to 180s (3 minutes)
- **BACKGROUND_TASK_TIMEOUT**: Reduced from 3600s to 1800s (30 minutes)
- **READLINE_TIMEOUT**: Reduced from 30s to 15s
- **NETWORK_COMMAND_TIMEOUT**: Reduced from 60s to 45s

### 2. New Timeout Constants
- **PROCESS_TERMINATION_TIMEOUT**: 10s - Maximum time to wait for process termination
- **ERROR_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT**: 5s - Time to wait for error recovery attempts

### 3. Enhanced Background Task Error Handling

#### Improved `_run_task` Method
- **Global timeout tracking**: Monitors total execution time
- **Error counting**: Tracks consecutive errors and terminates after max errors (5)
- **Enhanced status determination**: Better classification of exit conditions
- **Specific error types**: Handles subprocess, OS, and unexpected errors separately
- **Signal-based termination detection**: Recognizes SIGKILL (-9) and SIGTERM (-15)

#### New Error States
- `timeout`: Task exceeded time limit
- `terminated`: Task was killed by signal
- `failed`: Task failed with error code or exception

### 4. Enhanced Streaming Command Error Handling

#### Improved `_stream_command_output` Method
- **Error counting**: Tracks read errors and terminates after max errors (10)
- **Recovery attempts**: Tries to send SIGCONT to stuck processes
- **Enhanced exit code handling**: Distinguishes between different termination causes
- **Remaining output protection**: Safely reads final output with timeout

#### Better Progress Reporting
- Specific messages for different failure modes
- Signal-based termination reporting
- Error count tracking in progress updates

### 5. Enhanced Shell Execution Error Handling

#### Improved `_execute_shell` Method
- **Subprocess error handling**: Catches CalledProcessError with output
- **OS error handling**: Handles file not found and permission errors
- **Process cleanup**: Ensures processes are terminated in finally block
- **Enhanced return code interpretation**: Detailed signal-based exit reporting

### 6. Enhanced Subprocess Runner

#### Improved `_safe_subprocess_run` Method
- **Dynamic timeout selection**: Network commands get shorter timeouts
- **Comprehensive error types**: Handles subprocess, file not found, permission, and OS errors
- **Detailed error messages**: Provides context-specific error information

### 7. Robust Process Termination

#### Enhanced `_terminate_process_group` Method
- **Multi-step termination**: Graceful SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL if needed
- **Process group handling**: Properly terminates entire process groups
- **Error resilience**: Continues termination attempts even if some steps fail
- **Detailed logging**: Comprehensive debug information for termination process

### 8. Enhanced File Operations

#### Improved `_file_search_handler` Method
- **Error counting**: Limits search errors to prevent hanging
- **Permission error handling**: Gracefully handles access denied scenarios
- **Regex validation**: Validates patterns before use
- **Directory validation**: Checks if search root exists and is accessible

### 9. Comprehensive MCP Error Handling

#### Enhanced `_handle_tools_call` Method
- **Execution timing**: Tracks tool execution time
- **Output validation**: Ensures valid output format
- **Output size limits**: Prevents memory issues with large outputs (100KB limit)
- **Specific error codes**: Different error codes for different failure types
- **Detailed error messages**: Context-specific error information

#### New Error Codes
- `-32010`: Access denied (Permission errors)
- `-32011`: File not found
- `-32012`: System error (OS errors)
- `-32013`: JSON parsing error
- `-32014`: Execution interrupted

### 10. Version Information
- **BUILD_VERSION**: Updated to "2025-10-16-v5.0-ENHANCED-ERROR-HANDLING"
- **SERVER VERSION**: Updated to "1.3.0"

## Benefits

1. **Faster Failure Detection**: Reduced timeouts prevent long waits for stuck commands
2. **Better Error Classification**: Specific error types help with debugging
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Commands fail gracefully with informative messages
4. **Resource Protection**: Prevents resource exhaustion from hanging processes
5. **Improved User Experience**: Clear error messages and faster response times
6. **Robust Process Management**: Multi-level termination ensures cleanup
7. **Security Enhancement**: Better handling of permission and access errors

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite (`test_enhanced_error_handling.py`) has been created to validate:
- Invalid command handling
- Timeout behavior
- Permission errors
- Network command timeouts
- File not found scenarios
- Invalid regex patterns
- Path security violations
- Interactive command detection
- Background task errors
- Streaming command errors

## Usage Examples

### Command with Enhanced Error Handling
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "run_shell",
    "arguments": {
      "command": "nonexistent_command"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32011,
    "message": "File not found",
    "data": "Required file or command not found: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'nonexistent_command'"
  }
}
```

### Timeout Handling
Commands that would previously hang now timeout appropriately:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call", 
  "params": {
    "name": "run_shell",
    "arguments": {
      "command": "sleep 400"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "⏱️ Command timed out after 300s and was terminated"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

Enhanced debug logging provides detailed information about:
- Command execution timing
- Error recovery attempts
- Process termination steps
- Timeout events
- Error classifications

Enable debug mode with `--debug` flag for detailed logging.
